# Bash Scripts

This is a public repository of the bash scripts and my custom built python command line interface app called Squirrel

Squirrel_CLI:  This app creates project aliases, sets file transfer directories and streamlines git commits. 

Bash_Scripts: These are specific script for my laptop that has Windows installed and a Windows subsystem for Linux(Which I primarily use).
