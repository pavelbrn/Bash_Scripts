# Bash Scripts

This is a public repository of the bash scripts I use on my PC or Laptop.

git-update.sh:  Adds and commits all files with a message to the master branch.

get-wln.sh: This is a specific script for my laptop that has Windows installed and a Windows subsystem for Linux(Which I primarily use). This script moves files from my Windows Downloads folder into my Windows Linux Subsystem. I use this when I am on the go and don't have access to my PC.
