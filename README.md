# Bash Scripts

This is a public repository of the bash script I use on my distro. The gitUpdate.sh script is something I use on a daily basis to commit files on my local git repo.

gitUpdate.sh: Shows the status of a git repository, then adds and commits all the files to master branch.

get-wln.sh: This is a specific script for my laptop that has Windows installed and a Windows subsystem for Linux(Which I primarily use). This script moves files from my Windows Downloads folder into my Windows Linux Subsystem. I use this when I am on the go and dont have access to my PC and Ubuntu distro.
