# Custom CLI App and Scripts

This is a public repository of the bash scripts and my custom built python command line interface app called Squirrel

**Squirrel_CLI**:  This app creates project aliases, sets file transfer directories and streamlines git commits. 

**Bash_Scripts**: These are specific scripts that I used before before creating Squirrel.
