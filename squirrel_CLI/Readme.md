# Squirrel

Squirrel is an command line interface app that sets up your custom work environment
This command line interface app was inspired by my two previous bash scripts,
I decided to redoc both of the bash scripts using python for training purposes.
This is also an CLI app that I personally use or a regular basis.

Installation:
python setup.py install

-from <path>: sets move from directory"

-targ <path>: sets target directory"

-work <path>: sets your workig directory"

-work_alias <name>: creates an alias that will always take you to THIS directory"

-init: initiates work environment in this directory"

-uninstall: removes Squirrel data directory"

-gc <'Enter your commit message with quotes'> : shows git status, adds all files and commits them with a message you entered

-move: move a file to your target directory that you set up with -from and -targ"
